## Pool B - Uniswap Liquidity Farming Pool

![](../.gitbook/assets/liquidity-farming-pool-cover.jpg)

The Pool B is a community-developed liquidity farming pool for liquidity providers on Uniswap. All Liquidity providers \(LPs\) on Uniswap will be able to farm their LP tokens \(UNI-V2 tokens\) via our farming platform. 

There will be four vaults to choose from, each with varying time-lock periods and reward supplies. Three of the four vaults will last for 12 months from the start date, expiring on the 20th January 2022. The fourth vault will last for an additional 6 months until 20th July 2022.

### How will you start farming with YFD?

#### _Earn Uniswap Fee & YFD Tokens as rewards._

* Head over to UniSwap and locate the YFD/ETH liquidity pool under "Pools".
* Add as much liquidity as you like. This works in a 50/50 ratio between YFD and ETH.
* Head back to the YFD Farming Platform \(https://farm.yfd.io/\), connect your wallet and choose the vault that you want to contribute to.
* Deposit your YFD/ETH UNI-V2 LP tokens.
* Sit back and watch the rewards roll in!

### How are the rewards will be distributed?

* Rewards will be distributed on a daily basis but cannot be withdrawn until the end of the time-lock period for that vault.
* The APY earned is variable and will be based on the total number of farmers \(and LP tokens\) in each vault.
* A Liquidity Provider on Uniswap can farm and unfarm at any time, once the initial time-lock has ended. Each vault has a different length of time-lock. The higher the time-lock, the higher the reward supply.
