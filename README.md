# Welcome to YfDFI Finance

YfDFI Finance aims to become the first DeFi Financial Center fully powered by the community. The YfDFI ecosystem is a community-centered project aiming to rebuild all classes of financial services provided in traditional finance but through DeFi protocols \(farming, governance, insurance, credit, exchange, self-banking etc.\). All solutions will be community-developed and all profits generated by the ecosystem will be automatically redistributed to all contributors \(YFD token holders\).

A simple vision, powered by the community, profitable for the community: no limit, no discrimination, just DeFi for a better world.

## YfDFI Finance Ecosystem \(15/11/2020\)
