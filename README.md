# Welcome to Your Finance Decentralized

## Your Finance Decentralized aims to become the first DeFi Financial Center fully powered by the community. The YFD ecosystem is a community-centered project aiming to rebuild all classes of financial services provided in traditional finance but through DeFi protocols \(farming, governance, insurance, credit, exchange, self-banking etc.\). All solutions will be community-developed and all profits generated by the ecosystem will be automatically redistributed to all contributors \(YFD token holders\).

A simple vision, powered by the community, profitable for the community: no limit, no discrimination, just DeFi for a better world.

## **YFD Ecosystem \(08/04/2021\)**

{% hint style="info" %}
 Everything can evolve thanks to community ideas/proposals and votes. These docs will be continuously updated and date-stamped to fit the current reality of the ecosystem.
