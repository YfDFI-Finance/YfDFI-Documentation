# Governance

**Your Finance Decentralized Governance Model.**

**YFD is a community-centered project, aiming to build the first DeFi Financial Center, fully governed by a worldwide community of DeFi enthusiasts.**

**‌The ecosystem is governed by VOTX  token holders who submit and vote on proposals and who are eligible to receive a share of protocol profits. VOTX represents a right to govern and YFD gives the right to receive a portion of the ecosystem's profits. Most of the profits generated from each of YFD’s solutions \(DFI.Exchange, DFI.Swap, DFI.Insurance…\) will be redistributed to the community.**

**Anyone can suggest a proposal, firstly within the DFI.Community forum to gauge the community interest and secondly at DFI.Governance \(in the near future\). DFI.Governance will be a user-friendly platform to set on-chain community votes related to the YFD ecosystem.**

**The voting system will probably be discussed with the community before starting the development, but it will be ready soon to fully automate the decision-making process for YFD.**

### **DFI.Governance \(08/04/2021\)**

**‌**

* **Decision-making process:**
  * **All proposals are firstly discussed within the DFI.Community Forum. The proposals with more interest are sent to DFI.Governance for a community voting.**
  * **To vote, YFD holders will need to first earn VOTX tokens. This will be possible via the staking and farming platforms \(Pools C & D\). VOTX will also be purchasable on Uniswap.** 
  * **At the end of the voting process, the results will be directly available on DFI.Governance platform and then added to the ecosystem progress schedule, also available on DFI.Governance.**
* **Profit-Sharing:**
  * **As previously explained, most of the profits generated from each of YFD’s solutions \(DFI.Exchange, DFI.Swap, DFI.Insurance…\) will be redistributed to the community.**
  * **The idea is to automate the profit-sharing process thanks to monthly snapshots taken to proportionally reward every YFD holder.**
  * **A Vault will be developed to custody all profits generated every day within the ecosystem. This Vault will temporarily hold profits before distribution to YFD holders.**
  * **A small portion of profits will be sent to a smaller Vault dedicated to create a reserve for various operating expenses, DFI.Ventures community fund as well as community “Gigs & Rewards”. The percentage to send within this smaller Vault will be decided through a community voting in the near future.**

**As you’ve understood, we’re trying to build the fairest and most effective on-chain voting system to keep YFD as community-centric as possible. Some other improvements are already in the pipeline, like a gas free version or a multiple voting rounds version.**

**‌Of course, the platform and the overall ecosystem will continue to evolve through community participation to best serve its interest.**
