# Gigs & Rewards

To lay the foundations of the project, the first community members advertised "Gigs & Rewards" on a dedicated [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/yfdfi_gigs). The idea was to gather additional skills \(technical, marketing, design, writing...\) to community-build the ecosytem from scratch. Various community volunteers have been rewarded with [YFD Tokens](../tokens/yfd-votx.md) for their unvaluable contribution \(details on [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/yfdfi_gigs) and [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3CFD516eF2C73c5BB51e61C9943E46fB2dadE360#tokentxns)\).

> _Remember: YFD is a token issued without any value, initially a zero value token. Its value increase thanks to value created by the community in YfDFI Finance ecosystem. So, it's a good start to reward early volunteers with a governance token that is gaining in value day after day thanks to community contribution \(kind of community-value backed token\)._

To make it possible, 2000 YFD tokens have been reserved for "Gigs & Rewards". A [public wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3CFD516eF2C73c5BB51e61C9943E46fB2dadE360#tokentxns) available for consultation is holding and distributing those tokens to early volunteers responding to "Gigs & Rewards" calls and delivering the expected results.

In the near future, a fully decentralized rewards distribution system will be put in place. For this, we will rely on the [DFI.Governance](../solutions/dfi.governance.md) voting system and the [DFI.Ventures](../r-and-d/dfi.ventures.md) community fund. The combination of these two solutions will firstly allow us to community-vote improvements to fund, and secondly to be able to unlock funds from the community fund.
