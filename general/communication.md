# Communication

* [DFI.Community](http://www.dfi.community) \(Forum\)
  * The official place to open discussion within the community, many subjects already have their dedicated room \(General Chat, Farming & Staking, Proposals/ideas, Gigs & Rewards, Technical Discussion...\).
  * All improvement proposals need to be posted and discussed within the "Proposals/Ideas" room to become eligible for a vote on DFI.Governance.
* [Telegram \(Community Chat\)](https://t.me/yfdfi_finance)
* [Telegram Channel \(Gigs & Rewards\)](https://t.me/yfdfi_gigs)
  * To lay the foundations of the project, we've advertised "Gigs & Rewards" on a dedicated Telegram Channel. The idea is to gather additional skills \(technical, marketing, design, writing...\) to community-build the ecosystem from scratch, and especially to start creating a strong community spirit around the project. Some volunteers have been rewarded with [YFD Tokens](../tokens/yfd-votx.md) for their unvaluable contribution \(details on [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/yfdfi_gigs)\).
    * _Remember: YFD is a token issued without any value, its value increase thanks to value created by the community in YfDFI Finance ecosystem. So, it's a good start to reward volunteers with a governance token that is gaining in value day after day thanks to community contribution \(kind of community-value backed token\)._
